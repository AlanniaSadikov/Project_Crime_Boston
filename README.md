# Project_Crime_Boston


Do you think the number of crime incidents per hour could be correlated with the weather? Let's take a look:


In this project I studied the number of incidents (calls) made to the Police department from 2015 to 2019 vs weather variables.
Using correlation matrix, Linear and KNN models for regression I predicted the number of incidents given the weather conditions.
I was excited to see what I could find inside a crime data set so I focus my last final project on merging weather and crime
data to find any sight of relationship. You can find the data I used in
