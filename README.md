# Project_Crime_Boston

Do you think the number of crime incidents per hour could be correlated with the weather? Let's take a look:


In this project I studied the number of incidents (calls) made to the Police department from 2015 to 2019 vs weather variables. Using correlation matrix, linear and knn models for regression. The objective was to predic the number of incidents given weather conditions. I was excited to see what I could find with a crime data set, so, I merged weather and crime data to find any sight of relationship. You can find the data I used in Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston) and the weather data in the NOAA  https://www.noaa.gov/
